        <p>
          Pahlka Posse is a group of Turing School students who are passionate about civic tech. We named our group after Jennifer Pahlka of Code for America, whose leadership has helped us understand the possibilities in this space.

          Starting in March 2016 we began meeting to identify a project that would match our capabilities and interests as a group, as well as serve the Denver community. We have begun developing an application that helps low-income Denver residents to find suitable housing. Housing stood out as an area for impact -- it is the basis of individual wealth and stability, and shapes one's sense of community and connection.

          While current housing tools take some individual preferences into consideration, most do not adequately address the needs of low-income residents and those who depend on public transportation and public services. Our app, therefore, is one that helps users optimize access to vital services, employment opportunities, and community resources.
